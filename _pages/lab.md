We investigate methods, techniques, and tools to support interaction designers conduct user-centered design collaboratively with other stakeholders in various contexts, including serious games, software engineering tools, safety-critical systems, and general-purpose applications. Our research topic includes usability engineering, interaction design patterns, design systems, and other design tools. Our methodology, rooted in both human-computer interaction and empirical software engineering, is fundamentally centered on the human stakeholders of software systems, in particular users, designers, and developers.

**Research Keywords**: Software engineering; usability engineering; interaction design; early-stage design support; design artifact analysis; research methods for design study
