    <hr>
    <p><a href="https://www.polymtl.ca/etudes/cours/cspec-human-centered-inq-soft-comp-eng" target="_blank">LOG6953A</a> is an advanced undergraduate/graduate course offered <strong>in English</strong> at Polytechnique
        Montreal by <a href="http://jhcheng.me" target="_blank">Dr. Jinghui Cheng</a> (<i class="fa fa-envelope"></i> jinghui.cheng [at] polymtl [dot] ca). This course aims to equip students with
        human-centered research methods for understanding and supporting computer and software users, developers,
        designers, and other stakeholders. These research methods are especially essential in empirical software
        engineering and human-computer interaction.</p>
    <p>At the end of the course, the students will be able to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>analyze the research design strategies, logistical considerations, and ethical concerns of human-centered
            inquiry in the context of software and computer engineering;</li>
        <li>design and execute common human-centered studies and evaluate their advantages and disadvantages;</li>
        <li>select and perform appropriate analysis techniques to examine data collected from human-centered studies,
            and;</li>
        <li>effectively summarize and communicate human-centered research findings in software and computer
            engineering.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The course will cover the following topics:</p>
