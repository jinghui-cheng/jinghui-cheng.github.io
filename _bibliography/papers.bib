abstract = { As open source software (OSS) becomes increasingly mature and popular, there are
significant challenges with properly accounting for usability concerns for the diverse
end users. Participatory design, where multiple stakeholders collaborate on iterating
the design, can be an efficient way to address the usability concerns for OSS projects.
However, barriers such as a code-centric mindset and insufficient tool support often
prevent OSS teams from effectively including end users in participatory design methods.
This paper proposes preliminary contributions to this problem through the user-centered
exploration of (1) a set of design guidelines that capture the needs of OSS participatory
design tools, (2) two personas that represent the characteristics of OSS designers
and end users, and (3) a low-fidelity prototype tool for end user involvement in OSS
projects. This work paves the road for future studies about tool design that would
eventually help improve OSS usability.},

  title={The Impacts of Sentiments and Tones in Community-Generated Issue Discussions},
  year={2021},
  abstract = {The diverse community members who contribute to the discussions on issue tracking systems of open-source software projects often exhibit complex affective states such as sentiments and tones. These affective states can significantly influence the effectiveness of the issue discussions in elaborating the initial ideas into actionable tasks that the development teams need to address. In this paper, we present an extended empirical study to investigate the impacts of sentiments and tones in community-generated issue discussions. We created and validated a large dataset of sentiments and tones in the issues posts and comments created by diverse community members in three popular open source projects. Our analysis results drew a complex picture of the relationships between, on the one hand, the sentiments and tones in the issue discussions, and on the other hand, various discussion and development-related measures such as the discussion length and the issue resolution time. We also found that when factors such as the issue poster roles and the issue types were controlled, sentiments and tones had varied associations with the measures. Insights gained from these findings can support open source community members in making and moderating effective issue discussions and guide the design of tools to better support community engagement.},

There are currently no established guidelines for designing and evaluating interactions in AR as there are in traditional user interfaces. In this work, we aimed to examine the usability of current mobile AR applications and interpreting classic usability heuristics in the context of mobile AR. Particularly, we focused on AR home design apps because of their popularity and ability to incorporate important mobile AR interaction schemas. Our findings indicated that it is important for the designers to consider the unfamiliarity of AR technology to the vast users and to take technological limitations into consideration when designing mobile AR apps. Our work serves as a first step for establishing more general heuristics and guidelines for mobile AR.},

We then experimented with supervised machine learning techniques for automated argument extraction.

abstract = {Usability is an increasing concern in open source software (OSS). Given the recent changes in the OSS landscape, it is imperative to examine the OSS contributors’ current valued factors, practices, and challenges concerning usability. We accumulated this knowledge through a survey with a wide range of contributors to OSS applications. Through analyzing 84 survey responses, we found that many participants recognized the importance of usability. While most relied on issue tracking systems to collect user feedback, a few participants also adopted typical user-centered design methods. However, most participants demonstrated a system-centric rather than a user-centric view. Understanding the diverse needs and consolidating various feedback of end-users posed unique challenges for the OSS contributors when addressing usability in the most recent development context. Our work provided important insights for OSS practitioners and tool designers in exploring ways for promoting a user-centric mindset and improving usability practice in the current OSS communities.}

Function-oriented VR applications posed new challenges that are not well studied in the literature. Moreover, user feedback becomes readily available thanks to modern software engineering tools, such as app stores and open source platforms. Using Firefox Reality as a case study, we explored the major types of VR usability issues raised in these platforms. We found that 77% of usability feedbacks can be mapped to Nielsen's heuristics while few were mappable to VR-specific heuristics. This result indicates that Nielsen's heuristics could potentially help developers address the usability of this VR application in its early development stage. This work paves the road for exploring tools leveraging the community effort to promote the usability of function-oriented VR applications.}

This paper serves as a non-trivial first step towards resolving this challenge by demonstrating a methodology and establishing knowledge to understand how the contributors' roles and their dynamics, reflected in the activities contributors perform, are exhibited in OSS communities. Based on an analysis of user action data from 29 GitHub projects, we extracted six activities that distinguished four Active roles and five Supporting roles of OSS contributors, as well as patterns in role changes. Through the lens of the Activity Theory, these findings provided rich design guidelines for OSS tools to support diverse contributor roles.}

abstract={The growing adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) for tasks such as eCommerce, aerial surveillance, and environmental monitoring introduces the need for new safety mechanisms in an increasingly cluttered airspace. In our work we thus emphasize safety issues that emerge at the intersection of infrastructures responsible for controlling the airspace, and the diverse UAVs operating in their space. We build on safety assurance cases (SAC)- a state-of-the-art solution for reasoning about safety - and propose a novel approach based on interlocking SACs. The infrastructure safety case (ISAC) specifies assumptions upon UAV behavior, while each UAV demonstrates compliance to the ISAC by presenting its own (pluggable) safety case (pSAC) which connects to the ISAC through a set of interlock points. To collect information on each UAV we enforce a "trust but monitor" policy, supported by runtime monitoring and an underlying reputation model. We evaluate our approach in three ways: first by developing ISACs for two UAV infrastructures, second by running simulations to evaluate end-to-end effectiveness, and finally via an outdoor field-study with physical UAVs. The results show that interlocking SACs can be effective for identifying, specifying, and monitoring safety-related constraints upon UAVs flying in a controlled airspace.}

Over time, these comments accumulate into discussion threads embedded with rich information about the software project, which can potentially satisfy the diverse needs of OSS stakeholders. However, discovering and retrieving relevant information from the discussion threads is a challenging task, especially when the discussions are lengthy and the number of issues in ITSs are vast. In this paper, we address this challenge by identifying the information types presented in OSS issue discussions. Through qualitative content analysis of 15 complex issue threads across three projects hosted on GitHub, we uncovered 16 information types and created a labeled corpus containing 4656 sentences. Our investigation of supervised, automated classification techniques indicated that, when prior knowledge about the issue is available, Random Forest can effectively detect most sentence types using conversational features such as the sentence length and its position. When classifying sentences from new issues, Logistic Regression can yield satisfactory performance using textual features for certain information types, while falling short on others. Our work represents a nontrivial first step towards tools and techniques for identifying and obtaining the rich information recorded in the ITSs to support various software engineering activities and to satisfy the diverse needs of OSS stakeholders.}

In such systems, safety assurance cases (SACs) are an emerging approach that adopts a proactive strategy to produce structuralized safety justifications and arguments. While SACs are recommended in many software-intensive safety-critical domains, the lack of knowledge regarding the practitioners' perspectives on using SACs hinders effective adoption of this approach. To gain such knowledge, we interviewed nine practitioners and safety experts who focused on safety-critical software systems. In general, our participants found the SAC approach beneficial for communication of safety arguments and management of safety issues in a multidisciplinary setting. The challenges they faced when using SACs were primarily associated with (1) a lack of tool support, (2) insufficient process integration, and (3) scarcity of experienced personnel. To overcome those challenges, our participants suggested tactics that focused on creating direct safety arguments. Process and organizational adjustments are also needed to streamline SAC analysis and creation. Finally, our participants emphasized the importance of knowledge sharing about SACs across software-intensive safety-critical domains.}

We observed the use of GaPBIT in six game ideation workshops that involved game designers and therapists. The tool effectively facilitated collaboration in the interdisciplinary teams. Findings also suggested that information tools like GaPBIT support but do not replace informative collaboration among designers and subject-matter experts (i.e., therapists in our study). We argue that our findings and research methodology generalize to other domains where communication and collaboration among interdisciplinary design teams are imperative for designing "successful" games; i.e. games that meet the varied goals among stakeholders.},

Through a human-centered study involving five safety-critical system practitioners and 14 experienced developers, we analyze the way in which developers use requirements knowledge while maintaining safety-critical code, identify their informational needs, and propose and evaluate a supporting visualization technique.

abstract = {In most safety-critical domains the need for traceability is prescribed by certifying bodies. Trace links are generally created among requirements, design, source code, test cases and other artifacts, however, creating such links manually is time consuming and error prone. Automated solutions use information retrieval and machine learning techniques to generate trace links, however, current techniques fail to understand semantics of the software artifacts or to integrate domain knowledge into the tracing process and therefore tend to deliver imprecise and inaccurate results. In this paper, we present a solution that uses deep learning to incorporate requirements artifact semantics and domain knowledge into the tracing solution. We propose a tracing network architecture that utilizes Word Embedding and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models to generate trace links. Word embedding learns word vectors that represent knowledge of the domain corpus and RNN uses these word vectors to learn the sentence semantics of requirements artifacts. We trained 360 different configurations of the tracing network using existing trace links in the Positive Train Control domain and identified the Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BI-GRU) as the best model for the tracing task. BI-GRU significantly out-performed state-of-the-art tracing methods including the Vector Space Model and Latent Semantic Indexing.},

@article{Zhai2010,
abstract = {Security constrained unit commitment (SCUC) is one of the most important daily tasks that independent system operators (ISOs) or regional transmission organizations (RTOs) must accomplish in daily electric power market. Security constraints have long been regarded as difficult constraints for unit commitment problems. If the inactive security constraints can be identified and eliminated, the SCUC problem can be greatly simplified. In this paper, a necessary and sufficient condition for a security constraint to be inactive is established. It is proved that all inactive constraints can be identified by solving a series of small-scale mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problems. More importantly, an analytical sufficient condition is established and most of the inactive constraints can be quickly identified without solving MILP or linear programming (LP) problems. A very important feature of the conditions obtained is that they are only related to the load demands and parameters of the transmission network. Numerical testing is performed for three power grids and the results are impressive. Over 85{\%} of the security constraints are identified as inactive and the crucial transmission lines affecting the total operating cost are among those associated with the remaining security constraints, providing useful information for transmission planning.},
