    abstract = {Safety-critical software systems are those whose failure or malfunction could result in casualty and/or serious financial loss. In such systems, safety assurance cases (SACs) are an emerging approach that adopts a proactive strategy to produce structuralized safety justifications and arguments. While SACs are recommended in many software-intensive safety-critical domains, the lack of knowledge regarding the practitioners' perspectives on using SACs hinders effective adoption of this approach. To gain such knowledge, we interviewed nine practitioners and safety experts who focused on safety-critical software systems. In general, our participants found the SAC approach beneficial for communication of safety arguments and management of safety issues in a multidisciplinary setting. The challenges they faced when using SACs were primarily associated with (1) a lack of tool support, (2) insufficient process integration, and (3) scarcity of experienced personnel. To overcome those challenges, our participants suggested tactics that focused on creating direct safety arguments. Process and organizational adjustments are also needed to streamline SAC analysis and creation. Finally, our participants emphasized the importance of knowledge sharing about SACs across software-intensive safety-critical domains.}

There is an imperative need for supporting OSS communities to collaboratively identify, understand, and fix UX design issues in a distributed environment. In this paper, we provide an initial step towards this effort and report on an exploratory study that investigated how the OSS communities currently reported, discussed, negotiated, and eventually addressed usability and UX issues. We conducted in-depth qualitative analysis of selected issue tracking threads from three OSS projects hosted on GitHub. Our findings indicated that discussions about usability and UX issues in OSS communities were largely influenced by the personal opinions and experiences of the participants. Moreover, the characteristics of the community may have greatly affected the focus of such discussion.}

 abstract = {Many therapists who work with patients who have had a brain injury (BI) include games to ameliorate boredom associated with repetitive rehabilitation exercises. However, designing effective, appropriate, and engaging games for BI therapy is challenging. Following a user-centered approach we created GaPBIT (Game Design Patterns for BI Therapy), a prototype tool that leveraged design patterns to support designer-therapist collaboration when ideating games for BI therapy. We observed the use of GaPBIT in six game ideation workshops that involved game designers and therapists. The tool effectively facilitated collaboration in the interdisciplinary teams. Findings also suggested that information tools like GaPBIT support but do not replace informative collaboration among designers and subject-matter experts (i.e., therapists in our study). We argue that our findings and research methodology generalize to other domains where communication and collaboration among interdisciplinary design teams are imperative for designing "successful" games; i.e. games that meet the varied goals among stakeholders.},

By leveraging the network of traceability links that are present in most safety-critical systems, we can push timely information about related hazards, environmental assumptions, and safety requirements to developers. In this work we take a design science approach to discover the informational needs of developers as they engage in software maintenance activities and then propose and evaluate techniques for presenting and visualizing this information. Through a human-centered study involving five safety-critical system practitioners and 14 experienced developers, we analyze the way in which developers use requirements knowledge while maintaining safety-critical code, identify their informational needs, and propose and evaluate a supporting visualization technique. The insights proposed as a result of this study can be used to design requirements-based knowledge tools for supporting developers' maintenance tasks.},

abstract = {In most safety-critical domains the need for traceability is prescribed by certifying bodies. Trace links are generally created among requirements, design, source code, test cases and other artifacts, however, creating such links manually is time consuming and error prone. Automated solutions use information retrieval and machine learning techniques to generate trace links, however, current techniques fail to understand semantics of the software artifacts or to integrate domain knowledge into the tracing process and therefore tend to deliver imprecise and inaccurate results. In this paper, we present a solution that uses deep learning to incorporate requirements artifact semantics and domain knowledge into the tracing solution. We propose a tracing network architecture that utilizes Word Embedding and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models to generate trace links. Word embedding learns word vectors that represent knowledge of the domain corpus and RNN uses these word vectors to learn the sentence semantics of requirements artifacts. We trained 360 different configurations of the tracing network using existing trace links in the Positive Train Control domain and identified the Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BI-GRU) as the best model for the tracing task. BI-GRU significantly out-performed state-of-the-art tracing methods including the Vector Space Model and Latent Semantic Indexing.},

@article{Zhai2010,
abstract = {Security constrained unit commitment (SCUC) is one of the most important daily tasks that independent system operators (ISOs) or regional transmission organizations (RTOs) must accomplish in daily electric power market. Security constraints have long been regarded as difficult constraints for unit commitment problems. If the inactive security constraints can be identified and eliminated, the SCUC problem can be greatly simplified. In this paper, a necessary and sufficient condition for a security constraint to be inactive is established. It is proved that all inactive constraints can be identified by solving a series of small-scale mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problems. More importantly, an analytical sufficient condition is established and most of the inactive constraints can be quickly identified without solving MILP or linear programming (LP) problems. A very important feature of the conditions obtained is that they are only related to the load demands and parameters of the transmission network. Numerical testing is performed for three power grids and the results are impressive. Over 85{\%} of the security constraints are identified as inactive and the crucial transmission lines affecting the total operating cost are among those associated with the remaining security constraints, providing useful information for transmission planning.},
