            <h2>Information regarding the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the context of the research project titled 
                "How Open Source Communities Work Towards Usability Issues"</h2>

            <h4>About the research project</h4>
            <p>The objectives of this study are as follows: (i) exploring how the open source application software communities currently
            raise, discuss, negotiate, and eventually address these issues, (ii) investigating their perceived challenges in these activities
            and (iii) understanding how characteristics of open source practitioners (including their technical and cultural background,
            as well as motivational tendencies) have affected their perceptions and practices towards the usability issues. In order to reach our objectives, we intend to conduct a survey with open source software practitioners and community participants.
            This study serves as a first step in a larger project that aims to develop models, techniques, and systems to support software
            practitioners to consider and address usability requirements in an interdisciplinary and distributed environment.</p>
